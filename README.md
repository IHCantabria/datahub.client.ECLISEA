# datahub.client.ECLISEA

This project contains notebooks with different usage examples for ECLISEA data.

The researcher will be able, with the help of the notebooks, to generate a code to work with the data in a simple way.


## Installation

To work with the different codes it is necessary to have [conda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) (or [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)).

To create an environment with the necessary dependencies we use the instruction:

```sh
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

Once we have the environment, we activate it

```sh
conda activate eclisea-jupyter
```

And we execute Jupyter, which will open a tab in the browser with its interface:

```sh
jupyter notebook
```
